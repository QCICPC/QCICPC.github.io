        From Professor Snape to the Players:<br>
<br>
<br>
        The 16 problems below are from<br>
<br>
        https://open.kattis.com/<br>
<br>
        Solve them all (including confirmation by the Kattis judge.)  <br>
<br>
        In about a week, I will post some questions about these problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
        I expect a correct answer-code to each problem and correct answers to all my subsequent questions. (Or else...)  One answer is enough, but if you think that you can improve on what is already posted so that it is worth everybody's while to read your argument, then you should publish it. <br>
<br>
<br>
        At some point, Edward will publish instructions how to post your answers. Until then, get ready by coding up everything.<br>
<br>
<br>
        Regards,<br>
<br>
        Professor Snape.<br>
